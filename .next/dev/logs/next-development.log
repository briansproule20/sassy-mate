Export GoatArguments doesn't exist in target module

The export GoatArguments was not found in module [project]/sassy-mate/components/goat-arguments.tsx [app-rsc] (ecmascript).
The module has no exports at all.
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
